            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>In 2015, inspired by a desire to instil an entrepreneurial culture in NIT Durgapur, a group of three
                friends decided to start the first independent Entrepreneurship Cell of the College. What began as a
                small endeavour by three young minds has today risen to stand tall with over 70 members, achieving
                unimaginable things in just a span of few years. This journey would have never been possible without
                EDC’s incredible alumni who have worked ever so tirelessly to take the clubs to the height it has
                scaled. Today, EDC proudly figures among the most prolific entrepreneurship cells of the country, and we
                only hope to get bigger and better in the years to come!</p>

             <p>
              Inspired from Wow Momos Jeet Karmakar an alumnus of NITD came up with a startup plan to cater to the sweet tooth of NIT Dgpians in 2016.They had collaborated with 'Tatkal' a delivery based startup at  NITD for reaching out to the students. They even started online delivery services in South Kolkata. They developed from a small startup delivering sweets within the campus of NIT Durgapur to spreading its wings across the state where they were delivering authentic Bengali sweets right at one's doorstep.

            <p>
                Looking at the difficulties faced by the students of NITD to avail print out of documents, the founders of Printex came up with this start up plan in the year 2017. Printex came up with a vision to provide 24x7 printing facilities within the hostel premises itself. They provided printouts and photocopies at reasonable costs within the premises of the hostel round the day.

                PedalsGo is mainly working on cycle rental where booking is done via call. This is basically a campus connect programme where the cycle rental facilities are provided to the campus residents. It is a platform which is integrating many cycles under one umbrella. In future, PedalsGo will work automatically, where booking will be done through an app. Not only cycles but also electric scooters will be provided in future. The vehicles will be tracked through their entire journey.
